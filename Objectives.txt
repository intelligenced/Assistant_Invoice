+ table columns need to be adjusted, such that numbers must not have too much space, so it looks like a proper sheet.
+ sub total and toal must be properly aligned with bottom borders
+ margin needs to be adjusted
+ logo must be cropped, bottom border must be removed
+ fonts are now too too big, needs to be adjusted
+ background color needs to be lighter, see the subtle grey used by github
+ for the bottom, need to turn the logo and texts grey and small.
